## Problem

Community banks, credit unions, and CDFIs process 50–200 SBA 7(a)/504 loans per year. Each loan requires a Credit Memo (10–25 pages) that synthesizes tax returns, P&Ls, balance sheets, DSCR calculations, and borrower narratives — work that takes a junior analyst 6–12 hours per file. Underwriting backlogs stretch to 30+ days, costing deals and frustrating brokers.

## AI Solution

An AI that ingests raw borrower documents, auto-calculates key underwriting metrics, and produces a lender-ready Credit Memo draft in under 30 minutes.

### Core Workflow

1. **Ingest** — Upload tax returns (1040, 1120S, K-1s), 3 years of P&Ls, balance sheets, bank statements via secure portal
2. **Extract & Calculate** — AI parses financials, computes DSCR, global cash flow, debt schedule, liquidity ratios, trend analysis
3. **Draft Credit Memo** — Auto-generates narrative: business description, management analysis, collateral summary, risk factors, recommendation
4. **Human Review** — Underwriter reviews flagged exceptions, edits, approves in 45 min instead of 6 hrs

## Moat

- SBA SOP 50-10 compliance rules baked into prompts (regulatory specificity hard to replicate)
- Proprietary parsing for messy handwritten/scanned tax docs (OCR + financial schema)
- Lender-specific memo templates trained on each bank's approved format
- Network effect: each approved memo teaches the model that bank's credit culture

## Market Size

- ~4,800 SBA-approved lenders in the US (banks, credit unions, CDFIs, non-bank lenders)
- Each processes avg 80 loans/yr × 6 hrs analyst time = $4,800/loan in labor
- TAM: $1.8B in underwriting labor annually
- Beachhead: 500 community banks under $2B assets → $15M ARR at $2,500/mo

## Pricing

- **Starter:** $1,200/mo — up to 20 loans/mo, standard memo template
- **Pro:** $2,500/mo — unlimited loans, custom templates, SBA compliance checker
- **Enterprise:** $5,000/mo — API integration with core banking (Finastra, Jack Henry), white-label

## Why Now

- SBA loan volume hit $56B in FY2025, record high
- Community banks losing deals to fintech lenders with faster turnarounds
- Fed rate environment making every basis point of efficiency matter
- Junior analyst talent scarce — 18-month training cycle before productive
