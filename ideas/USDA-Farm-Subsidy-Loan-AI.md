# USDA Farm Subsidy & FSA Loan Application AI

## Problem
Small and mid-size farmers lose tens of thousands in unclaimed USDA subsidies every year — not because they don't qualify, but because:
- USDA programs (CRP, EQIP, EWP, ARC, PLC, FSA loans) have overlapping deadlines, dense eligibility rules, and 40+ page forms
- Local FSA offices are chronically understaffed; farmers wait weeks for appointments
- Most farms can't afford a dedicated grant writer or ag lending specialist ($52K+/yr)

## AI Solution: Core Workflow
1. **Intake & Eligibility Scan** — Farmer answers 15-min voice/text interview about acreage, crops, location, income, conservation practices → AI maps to all eligible USDA programs in real time
2. **Document Assembly** — Pulls farm records (FSA farm number, CLU maps, production history) and auto-populates Form FSA-2001, SF-424, and program-specific attachments
3. **Deadline Calendar** — Monitors USDA NRCS/FSA sign-up windows per county, sends SMS/email reminders 30/7/1 day before cutoff
4. **Submission Coordinator** — Generates a pre-filled packet + cover memo; schedules FSA office appointment or e-files via USDA eAuth where available; follows up on status

## Moat
- **Data layer:** Proprietary county-level program deadline scraper (FSA + NRCS + RD offices update inconsistently — most aggregators miss rural counties)
- **Voice-first UX:** Farmers are not desk workers; WhatsApp/SMS voice memo intake built for the field
- **Relationship with ag lenders:** Co-sell with Farm Credit Services, AgAmerica branches as a white-label compliance tool
- **Trust:** After 3 years, historical approval data per county/crop type creates a compounding success predictor

## Market Size
- ~2 million farms in the US; ~900,000 are small/mid-size operations that interact with FSA annually
- Average unclaimed subsidy per farm: $8,000–$40,000/year
- TAM: $300M+ (1% of subsidy value unlocked as SaaS fees)
- SAM (reachable via ag lender partnerships): ~150,000 farms → $135M ARR potential

## Pricing
- **Farm Direct:** $199/month per farm (cancel anytime)
- **Ag Lender White-Label:** $2,500/month per branch (covers unlimited borrower farms)
- **Success Fee Tier:** Optional 2% of first-year subsidy approved (for farms that prefer no upfront cost)

## Why Now
- USDA Inflation Reduction Act funds ($19.5B for conservation programs) are flowing through 2026 — massive surge in EQIP/CRP applications with no staffing increase at FSA offices
- AI document understanding (form parsing, regulatory NLP) now reliable enough to handle USDA's notoriously archaic PDF forms
