# Apparel Tech Pack & Spec Sheet AI

## The Problem
Fashion brands and private-label startups need professional tech packs — detailed construction specs, BOM (bill of materials), grading tables, and sewing instructions — to communicate with overseas factories. Hiring a technical designer costs $65–85K/yr and takes weeks to onboard. Small brands often skip this step, leading to sample disasters, wrong fit, costly re-samples, and production delays.

## What the AI Does
1. **Design intake:** Brand uploads sketch/mood board + fabric choices + target fit measurements → AI asks structured clarifying questions (stitch type, seam allowance, zipper spec, label placement)
2. **Tech pack generation:** Produces factory-ready PDF tech pack: flat sketches annotations, colorway breakdown, BOM table, care label instructions, size grading grid (XS–3XL)
3. **Factory communication layer:** AI translates tech pack into Chinese/Vietnamese/Bangladeshi factory RFQ emails, handles supplier Q&A back-and-forth
4. **Sample feedback loop:** Brand uploads sample photos → AI marks up deviations from spec (sleeve length off 1.5cm, collar gap, stitching density) and generates corrective comment sheet for factory

## Moat
- **Proprietary spec templates** tuned to category (wovens vs. knits vs. denim vs. activewear) — not generic form fills
- **Factory-language translation layer** (Mandarin/Vietnamese technical jargon) is a high-skill moat competitors can't replicate with GPT wrappers
- Network effects: as more factories use the system, AI learns which spec details prevent re-samples per factory
- Deep integration with Shopify/Faire for product launch timelines

## Market Size
- ~28,000 US-based apparel brands and private-label businesses (small to mid)
- Each spends $8K–30K/yr on technical design labor or consulting
- TAM: ~$850M (tech design + factory coordination labor in US apparel)
- Beachhead: DTC brands doing $500K–$10M revenue, 2–3 new styles/quarter

## Pricing
- **Starter:** $299/month — up to 10 tech packs/mo, 1 user
- **Growth:** $699/month — unlimited tech packs, factory comms, sample feedback
- **Agency:** $1,499/month — multi-brand, white-label exports, priority support
