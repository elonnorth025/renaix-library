# Pre-Construction Title & Zoning Intelligence AI

## Problem

Small-to-mid GCs and land developers routinely hire a Pre-Construction Coordinator (or outsource to a consultant) to comb through title reports, zoning codes, easements, setback rules, and HOA CC&Rs before breaking ground. A single overlooked easement or zoning overlay can halt a project—costing $50K–$500K in delays, redesigns, or litigation. Most GCs under $20M revenue can't afford a dedicated analyst, so they either skip this step or pay $3,000–$8,000 per project to a land-use attorney.

## AI Workflow

1. **Ingest**: Upload title commitment, preliminary title report, survey plat, and address → AI parses all documents (OCR + structured extraction)
2. **Zoning Lookup**: AI queries county/municipal zoning APIs or scrapes public portals → returns use classifications, setbacks, FAR limits, overlay districts, flood zones
3. **Conflict Detection**: AI cross-references easements, rights-of-way, and utility corridors against proposed site plan → flags conflicts with plain-English summaries
4. **Report Generation**: Produces a 2-page "Pre-Con Risk Brief" with red/yellow/green flags, recommended actions, and links to source documents—ready to hand to the GC's PM or lender

## Moat

- **Proprietary conflict matrix**: Trained specifically on construction-context title disputes, not generic legal NLP
- **County zoning integrations**: Scrapers/API connections for top 200 US counties by construction volume—months of engineering work to replicate
- **GC workflow fit**: Output formatted for construction PMs, not attorneys—adoption is sticky once templates are embedded in their pre-con checklist
- **Speed advantage**: 20-minute turnaround vs. 3–5 day attorney review; GCs close deals faster

## Market

- ~680,000 licensed general contractors in the US; ~120,000 active on projects >$500K annually
- Each GC starts 8–15 projects/year; ~10% hit material title/zoning issues = ~$2B in avoidable delay costs annually
- TAM: 120,000 GCs × $300/mo = **$432M ARR**

## Pricing

- **Starter**: $199/mo — up to 5 project scans/mo
- **Growth**: $399/mo — unlimited scans + zoning API access
- **Enterprise**: $899/mo — white-label + API for title companies and lenders
