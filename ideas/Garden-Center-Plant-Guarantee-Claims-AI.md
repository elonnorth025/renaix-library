# Garden Center Plant Guarantee Claims AI

## Problem
Independent garden centers and regional chains offer 1-year plant guarantees but have no system to manage claims — a $38B industry where 8–15% of plants die within the warranty period. Staff spend hours verifying purchases, diagnosing plant death cause (user error vs. disease), and deciding replacements. High-season overwhelm (spring/fall) creates backlogs, bad reviews, and $200–800/day in unresolved customer friction.

## AI Workflow
1. **Claim intake** — Customer texts/photos plant + receipt; AI captures SKU, purchase date, and current plant condition via image analysis
2. **Diagnosis** — AI cross-references local weather data, watering/soil inputs from customer, and plant species database to classify: warranty-valid (disease/defect) vs. user error
3. **Decision + offer** — Generates approved replacement credit, partial store credit, or denial with educational reason; sends to customer via SMS/email
4. **Staff review queue** — Edge cases (>$80 value, contested denials) flagged for 30-second human review with full context pre-loaded

## Moat
- Proprietary plant-death diagnosis model trained on species × region × season × customer care inputs — competitors can't copy without years of claims data
- Deep POS integration with common garden center systems (Epicor, Lightspeed Retail) for instant purchase verification
- Trust: customers get instant answers vs. waiting on busy staff; reduces "just give them the plant" default decisions that drain margin

## Market
~18,000 independent/regional garden centers in the US. Average store processes 400–900 warranty claims/season. Current cost: 1 FTE at $38–42K/yr + goodwill giveaways worth ~$15K/yr per location. TAM: $180M in labor + ~$270M in unnecessary giveaways.

## Pricing
$299/month per location (unlimited claims). ROI positive at just 25 claims/month.
